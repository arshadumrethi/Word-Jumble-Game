# Word-Jumble-Game
A Two player word jumble game, made in Python

It asks the first player to enter a word. (It hides the word that is being inputted so that the second player cannot see the word)

Then permutes all combinations of that word and selects one random combination from the list. (It does not count the original word from this list)

It then gives the player 3 chances to unjumble the word and guess the correct word. 

**Need to edit this game to permute using a permute function built myself instead of importing the permute module.
