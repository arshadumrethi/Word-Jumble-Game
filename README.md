# Word-Jumble-Game
A little game I made.

It asks the first player to enter a word. (It hides the word that is being inputted so that the second player cannot see the word)

Then permutes all combinations of that word and selects one random combination from the list. (It does not count the original word from this list)

It then gives the player 3 chances to unjumble the word and guess the correct word.
